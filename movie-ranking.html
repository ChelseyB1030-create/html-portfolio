<h1>The Best Movies According to Chelsey</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Favorites!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>It is a cult classic that has captured my heart as a child. The Stop animation was incredible for the time it was made, and it still stands on it's own today!</p>

<h3>The Neverending Story</h3>
<p>Another cult classic, if ever there were any. It is a movie I can watch alone or with my children and enjoy every bit of it!</p>

<h3>Repo! The Genetic Opera</h3>
<p>If you have not heard of this, and you like rock operas, this movie is for you! There are very talented musicians in it and it is gory and awesome!</p>
